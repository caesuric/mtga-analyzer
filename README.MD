Parses your MTGA logs and pops up a self-updating overlay tells you how long it should take you to get to your target ranking.

## Quickstart

2. Run `git clone https://github.com/caesuric/mtga-analyzer.git`
3. Run `pip install tabulate`
4. Navigate to the repo directory and run `python show-progress.py`!

## Other scripts

The other scripts are works in progress and not really ready for primetime, except for analyze.py, on which show-progress.py is based. To use analyze.py, run `python analyze.py --help` and follow the instructions it gives you to run the tool manually.
